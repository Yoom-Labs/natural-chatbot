This is my attempt at...

> A chatbot that reflects a human chatter
> with multiple texts in contextual based chats.

This may include natural areas for stopping and thinking,
certain words that allow for multiple texts, PRNG randomness
when it comes to which behavior to adapt to during
emotional times. Also includes the usage of "broken" English
and lots of acronyms like "ttyl" or "omg."

Later on, this may include context based chatting, such as
"ttyl I need to go to work" and then respond 12 hours later.
